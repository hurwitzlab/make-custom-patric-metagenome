#this seems to work just for cat'ing all the files
xargs -a just_patric_ids -d '\n' cat > contigs.fa
Since I used Taxoner to align to PATRIC things got a little confusing

tax_ids_to... txt has mapping of the NCBI taxonomy id (which taxoner uses) mapped to PATRIC ids (which has several X.1, X.2, X.N strains sometimes for each tax_id)

To get *exactly* which strain each alignment goes to you have to go back to the actual reads (which would be in /fastq-taxoner... directory) and follow this note:

#ID	taxid	unique_id	alignment_score	align_start	align_end
#HWI-ST885:65:C07WUACXX:7:1101:10000:13342  1469948 1222964 2.080   192292  192392
#unique_id can be grepped from PATRIC_final_genome_index.txt to give the PATRIC accession number 'accn|' to get the actual feature you have to go to the genome browser for the species and then
#enter in the start point (ex: 192292 in this instance)

***Path to PATRIC_final_genome_index.txt can be found in config.sh (or else!!!)

In a way, this doesn't matter, the contigs will be cat'd along with any spurious genomes, after alignment of each sample we can just filter out contigs with low coverage... we won't be losing any information
*but this might be important later in case of annotation

ok, this does matter... the contig.fa was ~17gb and bowtie2-build index wasn't able to create an index on TACC at 2 days of runtime (might have something to do with the really long fasta deflines but whatever)

now the solution is to cut down the size by fetching the specific contigs per genome (in the case of PATRIC, a strain of a species) per read

to make things as expedient as possible, i'm going to just modify the perl script that fetches sequences from fasta files... with the caveat being...

I need to make sure (ask Ken) that the Bio::Fasta::DB is able to take partial matches, since the deflines of the genomes (e.g. 1043858.3.fna) are long and something like this >accn|ATN0003842 E. Coli ATCC 3982 1043858.3 etc. the search string that I'll have is the accession string "ATN0003842"
