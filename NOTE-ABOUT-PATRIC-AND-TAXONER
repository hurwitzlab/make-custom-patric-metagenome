Since I used Taxoner to align to PATRIC things got a little confusing

tax_ids_to... txt has mapping of the NCBI taxonomy id (which taxoner uses) mapped to PATRIC ids (which has several X.1, X.2, X.N strains sometimes for each tax_id)

To get *exactly* which strain each alignment goes to you have to go back to the actual reads (which would be in /fastq-taxoner... directory) and follow this note:

#ID	taxid	unique_id	alignment_score	align_start	align_end
#HWI-ST885:65:C07WUACXX:7:1101:10000:13342  1469948 1222964 2.080   192292  192392
#unique_id can be grepped from PATRIC_final_genome_index.txt to give the PATRIC accession number 'accn|' to get the actual feature you have to go to the genome browser for the species and then
#enter in the start point (ex: 192292 in this instance)

***Path to PATRIC_final_genome_index.txt can be found in config.sh (or else!!!)

In a way, this doesn't matter, the contigs will be cat'd along with any spurious genomes, after alignment of each sample we can just filter out contigs with low coverage... we won't be losing any information
*but this might be important later in case of annotation
